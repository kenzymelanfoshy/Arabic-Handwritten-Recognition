# Arabic Handwritten Recognition
# Overview
This project focuses on recognizing Arabic handwritten characters using neural networks. The primary objective is to build a model that can accurately classify Arabic letters from handwritten images.
Accuracy : 98.09%

# The project is structured as follows:

Import Libraries:
Essential libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and others are imported to handle data processing, visualization, and model building.
Dataset Paths and Configuration: Paths to the training and testing datasets are defined, along with other configuration parameters like image size, batch size, and random seed.

Data Pre-processing:
Loading Data: The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

Normalization and Augmentation:
Image data is normalized and augmented to improve model performance and generalization.

# Model Building:

Architecture:
A sequential model is built using Keras, with layers for normalization and regularization.

Compilation
The model is compiled with appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and metrics.

Training:
Training the Model: The model is trained on the pre-processed data, with the training process being monitored for validation accuracy and loss.

Evaluation:
The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance.

# Results and Analysis:
Metrics: Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

Visualization: Confusion matrices and other visualizations are used to analyze the model's performance.

# How to Run the Project
Environment Setup: Ensure that all required libraries are installed. This can typically be done using pip: bash Copy code
